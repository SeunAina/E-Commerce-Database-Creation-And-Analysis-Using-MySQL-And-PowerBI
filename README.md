# Tradar---E-Commerce-Database-And-Analysis
This project focuses on designing  and implement  a  database  for  an  imaginary  grocery store.  The 
database captures and organize various aspects of the store's operations, such as 
product  inventory, customer information, orders,  and sales  data. I analyze the data 
and provide insights to support business decision-making
